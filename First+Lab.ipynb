    "    After running all the code I have made my conclusion about this dataset. Each dataset is wrought with flaws and biases however as a big data analyst I try looking past that. In this case, I noted spikes of increase and decrease between the days Friday and Saturday (increase) and Wednesday and Thursday (decrease). I assume that there was an increase in bikers from Friday to Saturday because of the weekday turning to the weekend with more going out due to school or work being over. However the sudden decrease between Wednesday and Thursday is inconclusive and I can not make a justified assumption for this. However for a date like 12/24/13 and 12/25/13, one can notice the sudden decrease between the two days, 603-221, because of christmas day. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Then there are the outliers like I explained in my previous question there are many spikes and decreases with the data usually due to natural causes or holidays as explained with the day of Christmas. After that there is the most popular day and direction which is westbound on a Sunday. Although I cannot explain westbound, I can reasonably infer that Sunday is the most popular because it is a day of the weekend. Also it is more than Saturday because it is the last day of the weekend, and the last day is probably when people want to finish errands and other tasks. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Finally the differences between September and the larger dataset. First off, in September eastbound was more popular than westbound. I can't explain this direction popularity because it does not have that many outside factors. Another difference is the days that are most popular, in the September dataset it is Tuesday, in the second dataset+first the most popular days are saturday and sunday. The second dataset includes all the seasons including spring and summer. The reason why saturday and sunday is generally more popular for biking is probably due to it being the weekend. Many people rest/relax and have fun on weekends. This is different because September is close to fall and probably less people have time to go out because of the general starting school year and the end of summer. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Although this dataset does tell me a lot about popularity on the Fremont Bridge, its many spikes and decreases also pose a problem due to the fact that many are not due to weather or holidays but are influenced by other external factors."
